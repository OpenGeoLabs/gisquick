# Gisquick

Gisquick (http://gisquick.org) is designed as an **open source
platform for publishing geospatial data** in the sense of rapid
sharing QGIS projects on the web. The platform consists of QGIS
plugin, QGIS server and Gisquick server and web applications.

## Important

Please beware, that current [Gisquick documentation](http://gisquick.readthedocs.io)
is not up to date. It was written for version 1.x, which is now obsolete and
no longer maintained!

Latest version of Gisquick is running on our [public instance](https://demo.gisquick.org).
If you would like to run it locally or your server, easiest way is to use our
[Gisquick CLI](https://github.com/gisquick/gisquick-cli) tool.

To keep track of substantial changes, planned features or new proposals, please
use [Gisquick RFCs repository](https://github.com/gisquick/gisquick-rfcs).
